# Network Models

As explained in the paper, the main focus of the project is on the development of two neural network models, (I) Property Network, and  (II) Mapping Network.

## (I) Property Network
Due to the expensive numerical computation involved during the structural design process, deep learning methods are being applied to speed up the process by replacing the numerical calculation step. Specifically, neural network based on ResNet architecture is being developed to directly predict the mechanical field associated with the structure design in a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). The illustration on the architecture of the Property Network is shown below, with the detailed explanation can be found in the journal paper mentioned above. The problem that is to be solved by the Property Network can be seen as a computer vision problem, in which an image on the structure (characterized by pixel values) together with the boundary condition (in this case the location of applied force) is used as input to the network. While the corresponding output is one of the important mechanical field typically being considered as objective value during structural design, strain energy field, which can also be represented as an image.

However, in order to successfully replace the numerical calculation of mechanical properties with Property Network, labelled training data are required to be generated through traditional numerical simulation. Since the process of training data generation is computationally expensive, the efficiency of the proposed method will decrese. Therefore, the training data is proposed to be generated by instead performing the numerical simulation at a lower mesh scale (coarse, or in analogy to image, a lower resolution). Then, a neural network is used to upscale the generated training data at lower dimension back to the original dimension (fine scale, or in analogy to image, the original higher resolution).

## (II) Mapping Network
Mapping Network is developed to upscale the mechanical field simulated at coarse mesh to fine mesh, therefore the Mapping Network essentially perform a super-resolution on the image. The architecture of the model is shown below with the detailed available in the journal paper.

The results on the performance and efficiency of the developed model are discussed in detailed in the journal paper.
